1. Node.js (Most Important)

React ka base Node.js hota hai, bina iske React kaam nahi karega.

Download:

👉 https://nodejs.org

LTS version download karo (recommended)

Check karne ke liye:

node -v
npm -v

2. Code Editor (VS Code best hai)

Likhnay ke liye editor chahiye.

Recommended:

VS Code – https://code.visualstudio.com

Useful extensions:

ES7+ React Snippets

Prettier

ESLint

3. React App Create Karna (2 Popular Ways)
A. Modern & Fast (Recommended) – Vite
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev

B. Traditional – Create React App (CRA)
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

4. Browser

Chrome / Edge / Firefox (koi bhi)

Chrome best for dev tools

5. (Optional but Important Libraries)

Ye sab baad me project ke hisaab se install hote hain:

Routing
npm install react-router-dom

HTTP Requests
npm install axios

UI Libraries
npm install @mui/material
npm install antd
npm install bootstrap

State Management (large apps)
npm install redux react-redux

Minimum Setup Summary (Interview Answer)

Agar koi puche: “React app ke liye kya kya download karna hota hai?”
To seedha bolo:

Node.js, ek code editor (VS Code), aur React ko create karne ke liye Vite ya Create React App. Browser testing ke liye Chrome.

Real Life Professional Setup
Cheez	Purpose
Node.js	React run karne ke liye
VS Code	Code likhne ke liye
Git	Version control
Chrome	Testing
Vite	Fast React setup
npm/yarn	Packages manage
Bonus (Industry Level Tools)

Agar tum professional banna chahte ho:

GitHub account

Postman (API test)

Figma (UI design)

Netlify / Vercel (deployment)

One Line Me:

React app ke liye minimum: Node.js + VS Code + Vite/CRA + Browser.
Baaki sab project ke size ke hisaab se. 💻🔥








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
